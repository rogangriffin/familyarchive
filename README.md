familyarchive
=============

When I began the project of archiving all of my extended family's photos and videos I looked for a place where I could best share these with the family in the most accessible and discussion-friendly place possible.
Social networks seemed the obvious answer but I found shortcomings in the way they approached events from the past, from difficulty in finding the events in the timeline, to limits in how far back dates could be set.
There are a few websites dedicated to the purpose of archiving family memories but I found them either cost prohibitive, lacking an open API, or lacking features that I considered essential.
That is when I began this project. The website neared a completed state, but I found the code had got unwieldy and so many web technologies changed over time as I built it that I have decided to do a complete rewrite using AngularJS instead of the hand-coded JavaScript that I did it in before. I also have decided to have my code hosted on GitHub and make it open source so that hopefully others looking for a similar solution can find it here and maybe contribute.
